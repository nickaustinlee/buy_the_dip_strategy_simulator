**Always Use Poetry** This project uses poetry. You can use it to run pytests and such. 

**Minimize Multiple Hops** I'm impatient so I'd prefer it if you read all the files you need upfront and then perform edits, rather than reading one file at a time and deciding to read more files and going back and forth with your thinking process. Just get as much context as you need upfront and stop wasting my time.

**The current time** It's January 2026. Python 3.14 exists and is stable. Stop thinking it's 2025. 

**Testing Local and on Github** We use Docker to test locally and Github Actions to test in the Cloud. Local testing should predict very well that Github tests will pass, so there should be alignment between tests locally and remotely.
